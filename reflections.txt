I have spent a few months working with HTML so I would say that the course so far has been quite easy, but I'm sure it will be difficult later down the road. I guess the most difficult would be adjusting to the Atom IDE and learning the shortcuts. I have learned more in depth about the trees and the names such as elements, tags, attributes. Knowing the names makes it much easier when I am looking for specific answers online. 

When looking at the whole at all the tools that can be used I felt like I was being overwhelmed, but using one the 3 specific tasks, I thought about how far I've gone and looked forward in the weeks to come to see how far I will be in my education.
